Hi there ðŸ‘‹ 

I'm Dominic and I'm a software developer. My interest lies in building well written and well designed software services. I've had at least a decade of experience in software development and had my fair share of successes, failures and embarassing implementations. I'm mainly a Java developer and hence have spent most of my career honing my OOP skillsets. I have always been passionate in building software services that matter and building them in a way that's easy to manage. In order to attain this, I'm currently tackling on IaC and CI/CD practices and continuously improve my knowledge on modern software architectures.

#### ðŸ’¡ My Philosophies (So Far)

##### Domain Driven Design
This is even more important when building complex services, regardless if they are architected as monoliths or microservices. All stakeholders have to agree in a common domain model as much as possible and this would reflect through a ubiquitous language. The code base should also reflect the domain. 

##### SOLID Principles
I would even go as far in saying that all you need to know to be good in OOP is learning how to practice SOLID in your day to day coding (in an OOP lanuage of course). Trying to understand the different design patterns by the GoF is useless if you don't have a good grasp of SOLID.

##### Fail Fast
Avoid analysis paralysis or gold plating and start experimenting on various solutions.
